    <h1>Enter Temple</h1>

    <p><strong>$T3MPL3</strong> is a revolution in the non-profit industry, and also an entirely new way to consider asset valuation in the crypto space. Non-profit corporations, perceived by the public as organizations, are actually legal entities that share many of the same structures as a C-corp, including a Board of Directors. These companies, authorized under section 501(c)(3) of the tax code, can generate tax-free revenue in business activities related to their mission, but unlike C-corps, they cannot raise capital by issuing stock. In exchange for this restriction, non-profits can receive individual or corporate donations, which are then used to reduce the donorâ€™s tax liability.</p>

    <p>Our society is shaped by this basic transaction. Individuals can divert taxes that would otherwise be owed to the government to their charities of choice, instead. The significance of this bargain cannot be understated: the non-profit sector employs roughly 1-in-10 Americans, and contributes 5% to the national GDP. Most consequentially, the entire higher education sector is run as a not-for-profit, as are almost all arts organizations in the Global North.</p>

    <p>If both of these sectors are so critical to the functioning of the developed world, why then, is education so inaccessible and expensive? Why are the arts so chronically underfunded? Most importantly, how does a small range of both intellectual and aesthetic trends dominate these sectors, and from where do they originate? The simplest answer is because organizations court large-scale donors for specific projects, and like an ouroboros, the donors only want to contribute to the same specific projects.</p>

    <p>But what if there was a different way? What if non-profits could hold IPOs, issuing stock like a C-corp? Instead of seeking donations to fund their missions, what if non-profits could raise capital from a multitude of sources, while its new shareholders continue to receive the benefit of a tax deduction?</p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>

    <p><strong>$T3MPL3</strong> is a token that functions in the tax-loss futures space. Best understood as a charity-coin, as more money enters the asset, the more the tax write-off is worth. For example, a long-term coin bought for $1000 could increase in value up to $10,000, at which point (after 366 days) the holder can donate it to the non-profit for a write off of the full amount. The investor only paid $1000, but will be able to deduct the full $10,000 value.</p>

    <h2>How it changes the world</h2>

    <p>Imagine a world where non-profits can quickly raise capital for their projects not by paying for a rolodex of donors, but by developing a worthwhile project that appeals to people across the country. Non-profits no longer have to beg for donations, suborning their mission to the strictures of the largest foundations. Instead, the most creative ideas in the hands of people who can best shape them into reality, will find the greatest sources of revenue.</p>
