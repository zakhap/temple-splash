    <h1>Enter T3MPL3</h1>

    <p>Trade memes, accrue deductions. Invest in future write-offs.</p>

    <p><strong>$T3MPL3</strong> lets you* accrue tax deductions while speculating (*US-based individuals can deduct, but <b>everyone can speculate</b>).</p>

    <p>We’ve replaced so-called “protocol fees” with charitable contributions to Qubit, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/qubit_nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a New York City-based non-profit</a>.</p>

    <h2>What is $T3MPL3</h2>

    <p><strong>$T3MPL3</strong> is innovation. It is a bivalent, tax-advantaged speculative asset. Choose your own adventure: speculate to maximize gains, or invest in future write-offs. 
        <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/041315/tips-charitable-contributions-limits-and-taxes.asp#:~:text=3-,The%20Bottom%20Line,on%20annual%20rules%20and%20guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The charitable donation is the most accessible and effective type of deduction</a>
        for the US taxpayer. Whether number go up or down, we’ve engineered your exposure to the market to produce a charitable donation. Note: For US taxpayers, “unused” charitable contributions can roll over into future tax years, impacting your take home for years to come :)</p>

    <p>This meme is a write-off, but don’t write it off.</p>

    <h2>Why? (cracked manifesto)</h2>

    <p>The US Government has structured the entire economy around the central premise that donations to charity are a way to maximize autonomy over personal finances. Every dollar donated to a non-profit is a dollar that is diverted from the US Treasury. But, most individual taxpayers don’t make enough money to meaningfully alter the flow of capital away from the Government, and towards the organizations that have a greater impact in their communities.</p>

    <p><strong>$T3MPL3</strong> completely subverts this entire paradigm. As money flows into the asset and valuations increase, donations can begin reaching non-profit groups in amounts never before seen. As profit increases, so does the diversion of funds away from the Treasury, and into the hands of people with important, socially beneficent objectives. Half the capital gains taxes you pay on every other crypto asset go directly to the US military. Fuck that. Let’s use the power of the state against itself and rebuild our society from the bottom up.</p>

    <h2>I work at a non-profit</h2>

    <p class="blinking-cursor"><strong>$T3MPL3</strong> is an entirely new way to fundraise. <strong>$T3MPL3</strong> converts attention into capital through memetics. Imagine a world where non-profits can quickly raise capital for their projects not by paying for a rolodex of donors, but by developing a worthwhile project that appeals to people across the country. Non-profits no longer have to beg for donations, subordinating their goals to the largest foundations and their drive towards social failure. Instead, the most creative ideas in the hands of people who can best shape them into reality, will find the greatest sources of revenue. For now, <strong>$T3MPL3</strong> is the proof-of-concept, but we will soon release a platform to launch unique tokens for any non-profit that wants to join the party.</p>
